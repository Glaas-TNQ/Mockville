# Mockville
Create a random real estate dataset 

I'll use my (little) python knowledge to put together a script that outputs a real estate mock database.
By tweaking the different variables in the script you can create multiple datasets relative to different zones in the city.
Each zone has it's own properties, and for the time being I'm going to keep every zone generator as a separate function
The idea is that in the future I'll be able to clean the code a bit (there are a LOT of if statements that I'd like to polish)
And maybe even add some kind of GUI using tkinter to allow less experienced users to explore the functionalities without headaches.

In the script you'll find some Hardcoded strings written in Italian that are relative to the tests I'm running, but variables and functions are written in english so
it should be pretty easy to understand how to replace them with your language of choice in order to create a dataset that's useful for your needs

By the way the script is now fully working, you can just copy paste it into your IDE and run it in order to create 5 xlsx datasets in your directory
Feel free to modify, adapt and improve on this version of the program, this was made for studying purpose and I'm more than glad if it proves useful for you
Just remember that credit and feedback is always highly appreciated
